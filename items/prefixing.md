=== Prefixing ===

Themes should prefix everything declared in the global namespace. This includes but is not limited to the following examples:

- Functions (including JavaScript functions)
- Classes (functions inside classes do not need prefixed)
- Variables in global namespace
- Image Sizes

Additionally options and customizer items should be prefixed (note that any options defined as `theme_mod`s are inside an array prefixed with theme slug).
