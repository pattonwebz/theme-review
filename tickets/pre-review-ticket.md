Hi @

I have done some preliminary checks on your theme to help speed up review process farther down the line.

'''''NOTE: This is not a full review and I am not the assigned reviewer of this theme. It will still be some time before a reviewer is assigned.'''''

I encourage you to test your theme with this plugin: https://github.com/WPTRT/theme-sniffer/releases. It was created by theme review team for use in theme building and review. All errors it reports need fixed, all warnings need looked at manually to determine if they need changed.
