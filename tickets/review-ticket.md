Hi @authorname

I have reviewed your theme against the list of (requirements)[https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/] for a theme to be added to the wordpress.org theme directory.

== Summary ==

During the review I found some issues that need to be looked at. In addition to looking directly at the code in your theme files I also used some plugins to help check certain items. I highly recommend you test your theme with these plugins to spot any blockers from being approved into the .org theme directory.

== Required ==

The items in this section will all need addressed to move forward.

== Recommended ==

The items in this section are recommendations only, you do not need to complete these for theme to be approved but they may help you to build a better theme. Some of these items are checked from this reference page: https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/recommended/ while others are from my own personal experience of reviewing themes.

== Notes ==

These are just some additional notes I have from completing my review that I feel are worth mentioning.

== Next Steps ==

If you could make some adjustments and upload a version that deals with items listed above I will review the changes and continue to work towards approving this theme.

The standard policy at Theme Review Team is that authors should try to respond within 7 days. If author does not respond within 7 days ticket will get closed.
